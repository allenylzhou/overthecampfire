“You must cover your face. Mayor’s orders, not my call,” the security guard shrugged as he stood in the way of two ladies trying to enter the grocery store. The ladies gasped in disbelief, having just waited twenty minutes to get to the front of the line. “We thought the order didn’t kick in until tomorrow,” they protested as they scuffled away. The next guy in line was wearing a plaid shirt and corduroy shorts, a confident looking tech bro with a wide grin and not a care in the world. As the security guard approached him, however, he sheepishly maneuvered to pull his shirt just over the tip of his nose. The security guard shook his head in disapproval.

Abiding by city ordinances, I stood at least six feet away, with a pair of airpods plugging my ears and a surgical mask covering my face, dreamily observing the scuffle. Had I anticipated grocery shopping to become such a struggle, I might’ve put more effort into a shopping list to cover all my bases.

The last time I wrote a shopping list was when I wanted to make fettuccine alfredo; it was meant to be a simple twist on my usual spaghetti marinara. I strode confidently to the pasta section of the grocery store, with its dedicated label and distinctive looking blue and yellow boxes: they read spaghetti, fusilli, rotini, linguine, the list went on and on. I stood with a hunch, eyes squinted, scanning row after row. *Why shouldn’t there be fettuccine? It rhymes perfectly with the rest of them.* Substituting my pasta and sauce was not as simple as it seemed.

The line moved again and I arrived at the front of the queue. Instead of a shopping list this time, I opted for a list of nutrients including carbs, protein, and fiber, with a touch of vitamins. My plan was to compose nutritious recipes on the fly, freeing my emotions from the whims of what’s in stock at a grocery store. As the masked guard turned to inspect me, I scrunched the sides of my own mask to shape it into a gargantuan smile that covered half my face and awaited his judgement.

When I entered the store, I saw two piles of baskets on the floor: my first choice of the day. I jumped from one pile to the other, reveling in my freedom as I selected the basket that looked to have the least amount of coronavirus lingering on it. Without a target aisle in mind, I turned to the first unlabelled section within my line of sight. 

A feast of pastries presented themselves before my eyes. My stomach made a happy sound as recipes spun in my mind. Pastries — the bread could be the carbs component, the stuffing could yield at least four grams of protein, pairing it with oatmeal could make my daily serving of fiber. Satisfied with my meal composition, I filled half my basket with a dozen chocolate croissants.

Past the pastries and the flowers was the produce section, full of sparkling reds and greens. My mouth watered at the strawberries, but before I had a chance to inspect them, the hums began. Three aisles of shiny refrigerators hummed in unison, an electric tune that complimented my grumbling stomach. My feet picked up its pace, gravitating towards their magnetic weight. 

I turned the corner into one of the aisles and there he was. A young man sprawled across the floor in the center of the aisle. I instinctively opened up one of the freezer doors, putting up a giant icy barrier between him and I. Store staff had already surrounded him at this point, but he was beginning to stir. My heart palpitated and my fingers raced as I snatched one frozen pizza after another and threw them over my croissants. Depending on which universe I subscribed to, I could have as little as a few seconds before he reanimated. I took a risk and moved closer; still six feet away, I looked into his eyes, he seemed confused but showed no sign of wanting to bite anyone just yet. I picked up a box of ice cream sandwiches, backtracked the way I came, turned the corner, and never looked back. There were enough pandemics going around without a zombie outbreak.

The line to check out snaked around all four corners of the store; by the time I made it to the front, my arms buckled under the weight of my basket. My nutritious meal for the coming week comprised chocolate croissants, frozen pizza, ice cream cookies, some meats, a keg of protein powder, vitamin gummies, a roasted beef sandwich from the deli, aluminum foil, and toilet paper. My cashier’s eyes lit up over that last find, “ooo, you’re a lucky man, we just restocked those this morning,” muffled laughter ensued.

I exited the store victoriously with two bags in hand. The key to winning against shortage of supply was to never specify what I wanted to buy. As I loaded my groceries into the trunk, my only thought was to sink my teeth into that roasted beef sandwich; they even toasted the bread for me. I furrowed my brows when I considered the cost: it was a $20 sandwich, an hour in line, and a near miss zombie attack. *Maybe I should just order a sandwich delivery from Doordash next time.*
